# To Run test cases

 - Required resources:
    - python3
    - pip
    - venv (included in python3)

 - create a venv in this folder:
    `python3 -m venv venv`

 - activate the venv :
    `source ./venv/bin/activate`

 - install required python libs
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 - run all test cases:
    `python3 restapitest.py`

 - be glad you didn't had to code all that in C++
